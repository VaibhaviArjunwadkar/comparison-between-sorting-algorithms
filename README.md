# comparison-between-sorting-algorithms
This project can be used to compare the time taken to execute different sorting algorithms on the different size of inputs. The Algorithms which I have used to compare the performance on input data size are Insertion sort, Merge Sort and Quick Sort.

The Project contains below files:
    o 3 source code files for three sorting algorithms written in python  
    o 4 data files arr20.txt, arr100.txt, arr1000.txt, and arr4000.txt. These four .txt files are initially blank.
    o After execution of each sorting algorithm it will create following output files for respective algorithms.
             ▪ Output files for Insertion sort (arrIS_O_20.txt, arrIS_O_100.txt, arrIS_O_1000.txt, and arrIS_O_4000.txt) 
             ▪ Output files for Merge sort (arrMR_O_20.txt, arrMR_O_100.txt, arrMR_O_1000.txt, and arrMR_O_4000.txt) 
             ▪ Output files for Quick sort (arrQK_O_20.txt, arrQK_O_100.txt, arrQK_O_1000.txt, and arrQK_O_4000.txt) 
 
 How to run the code on local machine.
- clone the folder
- Open cmd
- go to the source code file location.
- Run the first python code file named 'insertionsort.py' using below command:
      python insertionsort.py
  It will generate 4 data files (arr20.txt, arr100.txt, arr1000.txt, and arr4000.txt) and 
  4 output files for insertion sort (arrIS_O_20.txt, arrIS_O_100.txt, arrIS_O_1000.txt, and arrIS_O_4000.txt) at the same file location as that of the source code.
- Run the second python code file named 'mergesort.py' using below command:
      python mergesort.py
  It will generate 4 output files for merge sort (arrMR_O_20.txt, arrMR_O_100.txt, arrMR_O_1000.txt, and arrMR_O_4000.txt) at the same file location as that of the source code.
- Run the Third python code file named 'quicksort.py' using below command:
      python quicksort.py
  It will generate 4 output files for merge sort (arrQK_O_20.txt, arrQK_O_100.txt, arrQK_O_1000.txt, and arrQK_O_4000.txt) at the same file location as that of the source code.
- Now we have all the 12 output text files and we can now compare the performance of each of the three sorting algorithms by comparing these output files.
